# Entity bounding boxes will be uniformly expanded

# Time window (in ms) after firing a single shot with an automatic weapon
# during which automatic fire can resume if the player starts sneaking again.
#
# Example:
#   fire-resume-threshold: 1000
#   - Player fires a single shot at T=0 ms
#   - Player sneaks again at T=500 ms → automatic fire resumes
#   - Player sneaks again at T=1200 ms → too late, must click a firing key again

# Damage region thresholds based on hit height.
# Each value represents the **minimum normalized Y** required to count as a hit on that body part.
# The values must be in **descending order** (from HEAD to FEET).
#
# Example:
#   If normalizedY > 0.78 → HEAD
#   If normalizedY > 0.40 → BODY
#   If normalizedY > 0.08 → LEGS
#   Else → FEET

# Each sound is composed of the following properties:
# sound - The sound identifier to play.
#     This can be a built-in Minecraft sound (e.g., 'entity.arrow.hit_player'),
#     or a custom sound defined by a resource pack (e.g., 'custom.ui.click').
#
# category - Controls which volume slider in the client's settings affects the sound.
#     Available categories:
#       - MASTER
#       - MUSIC
#       - RECORDS
#       - WEATHER
#       - BLOCKS
#       - HOSTILE
#       - NEUTRAL
#       - PLAYERS
#       - AMBIENT
#       - VOICE
#
# volume - Controls both loudness and how far the sound can be heard.
#     - Minimum: 0.0 — silent
#     - Default: 1.0 — normal volume and 16-block range
#     - Technically unlimited, but:
#         · If volume ≤ 1.0 → audible within 16 blocks
#         · If volume > 1.0 → audible within (16 × volume) blocks
#         · Example: 2.0 = 32 blocks, 10.0 = 160 blocks
#
# pitch - Affects how high or low the sound is perceived.
#     - Minimum: 0.5 — one octave lower
#     - Default: 1.0 — standard pitch
#     - Maximum: 2.0 — one octave higher
#
# seed - Determines which variation plays for sounds with multiple internal variants.
#     To use a random seed, use -1.
#
# mode - Controls how the sound is played back.
#     - WORLD → Plays the sound at the location in the world so all nearby players can hear it
#     - PLAYER → Plays the sound directly to a single player only
#
# Defaults (if not specified):
#     category: MASTER
#     volume: 1.0
#     pitch: 1.0
#     seed: 0
#     mode: WORLD
